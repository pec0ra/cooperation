> * Group Name: The friendly prisoners
> * Group participants names: Byungsoo Kim, Basile Maret
> * Project Title: Influence of migration and reputation in the evolution of cooperation.

## General Introduction

Many studies have tried to explain the evolution of cooperation among unrelated individuals. It has been shown that migration alone, or reputation will promote cooperation. Most of the time, in real life, more than one factor play a role at the same time and we will model how the combination of migration and reputation will influence the evolution of cooperation.
We believe that cooperation will also be promoted in this model and it will be interesting to see how reputation and migration relate to each other.

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

We will use the well known prisoner's dilemma game. Our version of the game will include a migration system and a reputation system. 

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

How do reputation and migration influence the evolution of cooperation ?
How do they relate to each other ? How does reputation influence migration and does it affect it in a favorable way for cooperation ?
What are the necessary conditions for reputation and migration in order to promote cooperation ?

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

We believe that these mechanisms will promote cooperation. The reputation will probably help prisoners make better migration which will be favorable for cooperation.

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

We will base our model on their prisoner's dilemma game with migration and extend it with a reputation system.
