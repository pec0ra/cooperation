> * Project Title: Influence of migration and reputation in the evolution of cooperation.

## General Introduction

Many studies have tried to explain the evolution of cooperation among unrelated individuals. It has been shown that success-driven migration with imitating superior strategies, or reputation mechanism will promote cooperation where individuals pursue selfishness. Most of the time, in real life, more than one factor play a role at the same time and we will model how the combination of migration and reputation will influence the evolution of cooperation.

We believe that cooperation will also be promoted in this model and it will be interesting to see how migration and reputation relate to each other.

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

We will use the well known prisoner's dilemma game in a game-theoretical way. In this game, the players can take an action among two options: either cooperate or defect. According to their behavior, there is a payoff which motivate them to defect mutually rather than cooperate. It is represented by the payoff matrix below.

As it described in the above, mutual cooperation gives reward payoff R both players, and one defection between two players gives temptation payoff T for defector which is larger than R so that it induces the player to defect when the opponent cooperates and sucker's payoff S for sucker. In case of mutual defection, they will get punishment P payoff whish is larger than S so that it also induces the player to defect when the opponent defect. In sum, everybody is expected to defect, called the "tragedy of the commons' (Hardin, 1968).

Our version of the game will include a success-driven migration system and a reputation system. 

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

How do reputation and migration influence the evolution of cooperation ?

How do they relate to each other ? How does reputation influence migration and does it affect it in a favorable way for cooperation ?

What are the necessary conditions for reputation and migration in order to promote cooperation ?

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

We believe that these mechanisms will promote cooperation. The reputation will probably help prisoners make better migration which will be favorable for cooperation.

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
